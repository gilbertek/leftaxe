Hi I'am Gilbert Sewovoe-Ekoue. This is my blog, where I share my
thought, mostly related to software development, leadership, and life
experience from the trench.

I am primarily a Ruby developer these days with some front end technology in the mix.

I love exploring new languages and technologies, and enjoy hacking in Clojure
and I hope to work full time with Clojure someday. On the side I have
worked with and or explore Go/Golang, Python, Ruby, Elixir and Haskell.
